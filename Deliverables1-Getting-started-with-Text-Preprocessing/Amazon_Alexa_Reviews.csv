Very Very Average. Very disappointed. Underperformance.","This latest version of Echo Dot may be a better version than previous ones, but I am thorough disappointed with  Alexa Echo Dot. Many times it does not understand the command, many times it simply says Sorry I don't understand, many times while music is on it is unable to catch the voice hence you have to shout to activate the volume sensors for a different command. Majority of the music is picked up only from Amazon, no generic search for the song, you give a song name and artist name, many times it says that it's unable to find the song.I just had a quick glimpse of ChatGPT. The level of AI used is immaculate...it actually mind boggling.I bought ALEXA recently with a perception that ALEXA may have similar level of inbuilt AI, but let's say, ALEXA is far far away from being closest to AI.In first few minutes, I got to know and I declared it as a complete DUMBO.I repent. May be I was overexpecting. ALEXA may have good features for home automation, etc, however if you really want to use it majorly for your music needs, I would suggest you better drop the idea of going for ALEXA.I wonder how a person like Rajiv Makhni gives a complete Thumbs Up for this product and unlike earlier times, provides biased reviews without naming the device drawbacksHope above details help some friends to make the right decision.",15-Aug-23

Not upto the mark","No batteries always needs to be plugged in to power outlet. Speaker quality is not that good. Although it is responsive when it is called bot but it sometimes lacks the ability to proceed information. There built in motion detection was not working in the piece that i got and is calling out the temperate that the weather forecast is showing, though the builtin temperature sensor for calibrated still it is telling the data provided by the weather stations.",04-Jul-23

Echo Dot 5th Gen is Awesome","I bought this Echo Dot 5th Gen for my daughter as a birthday gift. She was extremely surprised and very happy. Connecting to Device is very easy and fast. When connect through Alexa app there are many options to try and enjoy the moments. This echo Dot 5th gen delivers brillant crisp and appropriate bass for any type of song witg Loud and clear sound. It comes with motion detection and Temperature sensor which works very well. We use it for everyday activities as a reminders, orders, breaking news, jokes, songs, podcast etc... I would recommend this small cute Echo Dot 5th Gen for all ages. It is the first Robot in my house and everyone is so happy and excited üëèüëèüëåüëç",22-Jul-23

Needs a lot of improvements.","a. Occupancy sensor:- At times when I study, it does not detect me. It switches off appliances because I have set a routine. To appear like a human being, at times I move while seated on my chair.- There is no proper documentation for this feature. I had to have three different conversations with the customer care to understand the feature.b. Temperature detection:- It does not always work. There are times that it detected higher temperature and switched my AC on. Most of the time, it does not detect when the room temperature falls below a certain point; and thus, it does not switch the AC off.- Continuing with the previous statement: I think it checks periodically for the temperature and it is not done real time. For example: If the routine says to switch the AC off if the temperature drops below 23, there are times it switched the AC off at 22.5 and there were times when the room was at 19 degrees but still the AC was not switched off automatically. I am told by the customer care that my device is faulty. I have asked for a replacement of the product.",02-Apr-23

Excellent companion with minor bugs","It is an excellent companion. However, it has few flaws as listed below (as per two days of usage):1. Playing same songs again and again. Forcing to buy a package from the music partners. Also, the playlist always starts from the same song and continues the same list (even though shuffle is enabled). That's why 1 star less.2. Not giving appropriate answers sometimes.3. Not having a memory like Google Assistant. Not remembering the things happened.4. Even though, profile is created for specific person, it is responding to all voices. No use for profile creation except remembering the profile name.Overall, it needs a few updates to solve the bugs. However, it's the best companion and a new family member.",07-Mar-23

Frustratingly Unresponsive: Amazon Alexa's Listening Skills Need Serious Improvement","The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Where do I even begin with my disastrous experience with Amazon Alexa? I can confidently say that my interaction with this so-called ""smart"" device has been nothing short of a nightmare. Alexa's severe lack of responsiveness and its infuriating tendency to play ""Happy Birthday to You"" on loop have left me exasperated and utterly disappointed.First and foremost, Alexa's main selling point is its voice recognition capability, but it seems to have taken a nosedive into incompetence. Despite speaking loud and clear, Alexa appears to have developed selective hearing. It is frustratingly unresponsive, failing to register even the most basic commands. It's as if I'm speaking to a brick wall rather than an intelligent virtual assistant.But that's not the worst part. Oh no, the worst part is the endless repetition of ""Happy Birthday to You."" It's as if Alexa has developed an unhealthy obsession with this one particular song. No matter what query I make or command I give, it responds by launching into an endless rendition of ""Happy Birthday to You."" It's mind-numbingly repetitive and offers absolutely no value or utility.I've tried every possible troubleshooting option imaginable, from resetting the device to adjusting its sensitivity, but nothing seems to rectify Alexa's misbehavior. It's as if this device has a mind of its own, and that mind is entirely focused on torturing its users with an unending birthday anthem.Furthermore, Alexa's lack of intelligence is evident in its inability to learn and adapt. It doesn't grasp context or understand conversational nuances, rendering any attempt at natural interaction futile. It's like communicating with a robotic parrot that mindlessly repeats pre-programmed phrases.Considering the exorbitant price I paid for this ""smart"" device, I expected a lot more than an endless loop of ""Happy Birthday to You."" Amazon Alexa's failure to fulfill its basic function as a voice assistant and its inability to comprehend simple commands or engage in meaningful conversation is a colossal disappointment.In conclusion, my experience with Amazon Alexa has been an exercise in frustration and regret. Its failure to listen, its incessant repetition of ""Happy Birthday to You,"" and its overall lack of intelligence make it an infuriating piece of technology that is simply not worth the investment. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a truly smart and capable virtual assistant.",24-May-23

Honest Reviews after 5 days","HonestIy, if you're looking to upgrade your Alexa Echo Gen4, then don't!Or if you're purchasing it for the first time, even then going for it would not be fine because it just has 2-3 more features than Gen4, that personally for me, won't be that important.I'm pretty sure that with upcoming updaes Gen5 will do better but for now lots of bugs are there that can make you feel irritated sometimes.#Doesn't respond#Not able to find particular song or playlist.#Listenes to everyone even when there's one profile made.#Small bugs like disconnecting whrn phone is connected.I'll suggest you to go for Echo Gen4",09-Mar-23

Not worthy of being called as AI device in 2023","I have used the primitive generation of the Alexa and was impressed, however with every new generation it has only detoriated. I would rather bought Google home as it would seamlessly connect with my google ecosystem.It doesn't shows as a device while playing from apps other than the Amazon music.
